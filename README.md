This exercise has automated tests that check your work for correctness. This is similar to how freeCodeCamp tests your code before you can proceed to the next exercise.

These tests will be run when you submit your work.

**Install dependencies needed to run tests**

To start the tests, open your terminal in VS Code for this exercise, and type the following:

```bash
npm install
```

You only have to do this once.

**Starting the tests and keeping them running**

You can have the tests running as you write your code. Every time you save your `script.js` file, the tests will rerun. It will be your job to make the tests pass, one by one. To start the tests in watch mode, type the following into your terminal:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

To stop the tests, type `control` + `c` in your terminal.

Watch this [example video of running tests](https://vimeo.com/440650789/c09e688f9b) to see how it works

**Running the tests on-demand**

If you want to run the tests on-demand, you can type the following into your terminal:

```bash
npm test
```

## Instructions

1. Open `Submission/index.html` in your browser with Live Server, and `Submission/static/js/script.js` in VS Code.
2. Follow the instructions in `Submission/static/js/script.js` to complete the variables using template strings
